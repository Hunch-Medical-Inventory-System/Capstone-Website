## 📌 Our Project  
We are continuing development of the **NFC (Near Field Communication) based Medical Inventory System** from last year, with a focus on delivering several major enhancements.  

Key upgrades include:  
- ✅ Addition of **iOS support**  
- ✅ Integration of a **more advanced AI model**  
- ✅ Comprehensive **design overhaul**  
- ✅ Targeted **usability and quality-of-life improvements**  

These initiatives aim to strengthen performance, broaden accessibility, and improve the overall user experience.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
This project is built around a **SQL-based database** integrated with an **NFC reader**, which may be implemented through a smartphone or any other NFC-capable device.  

- **NFC Stickers** placed on individual items act as unique identifiers.  
- Users can **scan items in and out** of the database for **real-time tracking** and **accurate inventory management**.  

In addition, the system incorporates a **built-in AI component** designed to provide intelligent support:  
- 📊 Analyze inventory data  
- 💡 Generate insights and recommendations  
- 🏥 Assist in diagnostic decision-making  

This ensures the system not only manages inventory efficiently but also provides **practical medical value**.

## 🎯 Our Goals  
Our objective is to design and develop a **comprehensive medical inventory system** and present it as part of the **NASA HUNCH program**.  

We aim to:  
- Demonstrate **technical functionality** of the system  
- Showcase its **real-world applicability and impact**  
- Qualify for the **final showcase in Texas**, delivering a **polished, engaging presentation** highlighting innovation and value
